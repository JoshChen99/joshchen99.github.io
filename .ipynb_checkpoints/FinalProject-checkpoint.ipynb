    "Ever since I was little, I've followed sports. Collecting cards, reading up on the news and watching many games as most kids do. And one thing that is constantly discussed in sports is the data, especially more so in recent years as technology and models have advanced. The prime example being the infamous Moneyball A's. But in recent years, if you read many sports articles, they always mention statistics and data. For example, the 2017 Superbowl between the Patriots and the Falcons where the Patriots came back from a .02% chance of winning (according the ESPN's win-probability graph). The models and statistics and unlikelihood of the comeback were talked about for months, especially in the highly data driven NFL, where every play can be broken down and analyzed thoroughly. The same can be said for basketball, baseball, and tennis. But one sport where this fails is soccer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Soccer has been the \"problem child\" of sports data science as the game was always considered too complicated and too fluid to be analyzed. Many managers and coaches relied on instinct and feel for the game and still rely on these traits. But slowly over time, this has been changing. I'm a huge Liverpool fan and earlier in the year read an article about how Liverpool has gone from mediocre over the past few years to completely dominant with the help of their analytics department (https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/magazine/soccer-data-liverpool.html). Many of Liverpool's world-class bargain signings came from their analysis of the data and statistics that people can't see. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the inspiration and the idea behind this tutorial. Can a model be created to predict which players will become world-class players? In this tutorial, I'll be taking data from FIFA's assessment of players over the past 5 years and create a model to try to predict player's current level of play. I'll compare my model with FIFA's most recent assessment as well as the player's current in-game form. I hope that this tutorial show fans that data can be used to help assess players and perhaps get the more data-driven people who aren't soccer fans to look into cracking one of the hardest sports to analyze through data."

    "\n",
    "I decided to use this data as it is a very comprehensive list of players and one of the most easily obtainable. It provides similar metrics over the last few years as FIFA hasn't changed the metrics it collects on players. Another reason is that data for soccer isn't that readily available. Most data is collected by individuals who want to mess with it and can be found via Twitter graphs or is super expensive and professional (<a href = \"https://www.optasports.com/\">Opta</a> being on of the only distributors). Thus, I settled for the best I could do which is this FIFA data."

    "With all the various skills that are listed in FIFA, it would seem impossible that any one player would be a master in all and that is correct. What FIFA actually does to assess a player's overall rating is to assess what FIFA has deemed the necessary skills for the player's position. FIFA assigns different skills to different positions and then also weighs the skills in importance to create the player's final overall rating. In order to assess the overall rating correctly between the years and to create a standard, I will be reevaluating previous years from 2015-2018 which used a different calculation for the overall rating from 2019 and 2020 with the standard used in 2019 and 2020. Many people have experimented with player values to find the exact coefficients which is more explained <a href = \"https://www.fifauteam.com/player-ratings-guide-fifa-19/\"> here</a>. But these are the standards that will be used.\n",
